# Advanced Line Recognition #

## Introduction ##
This repository contains an extension for [Continia Document Capture](http://continia.com/documentcapture-for-dynamics-nav.aspx) module, which is a solution for scanning of invoices and other documents directly from inside Microsoft Dynamics Business Central/NAV! 

The code will be unregularly maintained or updated. 

## Remark ##
You can use this code as it is, without any warranty or support by me, [Continia Software A/S](https://www.continia.com "Continia Software"). 

You can use the Advanced Line Recognition on your own risk. 

**If you find issues in the code, please report these in the issues list here on Github.**

## Documentation ##
At the moment there is no other documentation than this readme file.

## Current Features ##
1. Find a field value by linking it to a previously found field and automatically calculating the distance and size
2. Find a field value by searching for a caption in the current position (sames procedure like on header fields - but only processed in the current position range)
3. Find a field value by the column heading (same procedure/training) like on default line fields. This enables the user to capture values based on the column that are not in the default line of the current position
4. Define a substitution value. If it was not able to find a value for a field you can define another field, who's value will be set as value for the field with the empty value.
5. Copy a value from the previous line. If it was not able to find a value for a field the system will use the value of this field from the previous line. 

## Implementation of the extension ##
The code will be updated unregularly for new versions of Document Capture.

1. Clone the project / Download all  *.txt files to your client
2. Import all txt files into your database via the development environment 
3. Filter the versionlist for *ALR* and compile all objects

## How to use the extension ##
The concept of the Advanced Line Recognition extension is to identify at least one field per line by Document Capture standard code - we'll call this field "line identification field" (LIF) in this guide.

Based on the position of this field the user will define the "offset" of other fields that he wants to capture. 

![](https://github.com/sradloff/Document-Capture/blob/master/Advanced%20Line%20Recognition/Documentation/ExampleDocument.png)

1. Open Dynamics NAV Client
2. Import open Documents to Document Capture
3. Open the Document Journal
4. Run `Recognize Fields` action from the menu to recognize the fields of the selected document
5. Open the Document Card from the menu
6. Capture the LIF
7. Mark the **values** of the offset fields with left mouse button
8. Link the offset fields to the LIF via line action `Adv. line recognition` ==> `Link to line ident. field`
9. Test your setup by `Recognize Fields`
